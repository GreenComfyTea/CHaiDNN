The original CHaiDNN repo contains several errors and mistakes in paths and commands. The repo and tutorials here have these things fixed to simplify the process of creating and compiling a project. If you want to use the original repo then be prepared to fix errors by yourself and be aware of new commits and changes to the original repo if that happens.
